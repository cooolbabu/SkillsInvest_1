### Key roles that a Technical Product Manager plays: 
Work with technical teams: A technical product manager works with the technical teams to meet project demands. This includes the development team, engineering team, QA team, and more. Since the technical product manager already has a solid technical background, they can relay the business objectives to the technical team and ensure everything is on track.

Assess technical risks: A technical product manager is also responsible for assessing technical risks and working with the technical team to mitigate them. This includes identifying potential roadblocks during development and working with the development team to make sure they are addressed. Additionally, the technical product manager helps create contingency plans for the risks associated with the project.

Develop product strategy: A technical product manager is responsible for developing the product strategy and business objectives. They work with stakeholders to understand the customer’s needs and create a product that meets their requirements. With product strategy, the technical product manager bridges the business and technical requirements for a successful product.

Coordinate product releases: A technical product manager’s job is not done with just developing the product, they are also responsible for coordinating product releases with the development team and stakeholders. This includes ensuring that all parties know deadlines and working to meet them. They play an essential role in development, sales, marketing, and more.

Manage customer feedback: The technical product manager is also responsible for managing customer feedback and relaying it to the development team.

### Best Qualities to look for in a Technical Product Manager
The technical product manager cannot thrive off only a few skills; they need certain qualities to ensure they succeed in your organization. 

A robust understanding of how technical product management works is crucial in hiring because it will allow your organization to hire the best candidates. 

From technical expertise to effective communication, your technical product manager’s different qualities will significantly impact your project’s success. Some of the best qualities you should look for in a technical product manager include the following:

- 1. Technical Expertise (A must for every Technical Product Manager): 
Their advanced design, engineering, or development skills separate technical and ordinary product managers. More specifically, the technical product manager should have expertise in the frameworks and technologies that the company uses. For example, the technical product manager should be familiar with its approaches and applications if you have a team that uses scrum project management. 

With an adequate technical understanding of the technologies and frameworks being used for a project, the technical product manager will be able to give guidance on the product features and roadmaps. This creates more product development bottlenecks and ultimately slows the entire team. Before hiring a technical product manager, do due diligence and ensure they thoroughly understand the technical frameworks your organization uses.

- 2. Cross-functional Collaboration:
 In addition to having the technical chops, the technical product manager must be able to collaborate with other teams easily to meet shared objectives within the company. Many businesses have several teams working on building a single product, including development teams, design teams, management, customer support, and more. The technical product manager doesn’t have the luxury of just focusing on their team; they have to collaborate effectively with other teams to accomplish shared objectives. 

If the SEO team is working on on-page SEO to promote the product, the technical product manager should be in the loop and know how this correlates with the product’s success. 

A successful product launch will require designers, engineers, and marketing teams to collaborate. The technical product manager ensures technical teams have all the resources necessary to create a minimum viable product. Once an early version of a product is created, the technical product manager must collaborate with other teams to get feedback and strategize on how to launch the product. 

This continuous process of developing the product, marketing it, etc., requires constant communication between teams. A great technical product manager will act as the main point of contact between different teams and help accelerate product development for the entire organization. 

- 3. Product Vision: 
The technical product manager is one of the best leaders in outlining the product vision for a team. Since the technical product manager understands the technical and business aspects of building a successful product, they take an active role in product vision and strategy. The product vision generally includes the product’s main objectives and overarching goals. 

The technical product manager helps define and set the product’s vision parameters. Since product vision impacts virtually every aspect of product development, your team relies on the technical product manager to set a clear vision for the product you are creating. Before hiring a technical product manager, ask them about different products they’ve worked on and the vision they set for their teams. 

A competent technical product manager will be able to articulate the vision because they probably worked on most aspects of product strategy. It’s essential to ensure that your technical product manager can set a product vision because only some team members can do so. This is a key differentiating factor that separates average technical product managers from great ones. 

- 4. Industry Knowledge:
 A product manager requires much industry knowledge to succeed, and a technical product manager is no different. To take a product from the ideation stage to real-life application, a product manager must be knowledgeable about the industry to help create a product that solves customer pain points. Before starting to work on a product, there has to be thorough market research done by the technical product manager. Without this, the company may create a product with little to no demand.

 To do anything related to market research, the technical product manager must have basic knowledge of the industry and what customers are looking for. For example, if you’re in the IT services industry, your technical product manager should be aware of trends, customer wants, and other specific IT-related factors. 

In addition to market research, industry knowledge allows a technical product manager to keep up with the trends in the industry. Often, product success can be attributed to the right timing. If your technical product manager has a good pulse on the industry, they can help the company pivot and gain a competitive advantage by bringing products to market faster. This is an essential quality to look for in your technical product manager. Along the same lines, familiarity with industry-related tools such as product prototyping software or customer feedback software is a must in a good product manager.”

- 5. Customer-oriented: 
Being customer-oriented is essential to being an excellent technical product manager. All the work is done to satisfy customers and help them meet their goals. Since the technical product manager has a thorough understanding of the technical and non-technical aspects of the product, they are often the best person to communicate with customers. With detailed knowledge of the product, the technical product manager can help convey hard technical concepts in an easy way that illustrates the benefits to customers.
